        <p style="padding: 0 24px;font-family: roboto;line-height: 22px;">Zinc, a metal used in a composite panel, naturally inherits the power of self-healing. A material that can remain fit by healing scratches and damages on it, and has the ability to resist corrosion! This means the building will be able to self-heal itself and be corrosion-free, reducing the stress of repairs. Let’s see these abilities from the point of view of science. when the surface of Zinc comes in contact with moisture and carbon dioxide in the air, it goes through a unique reaction. A protective layer called a Patina of ‘zinc carbonate forms on its surface, which heals scratches and other damages from the surface, thus making zinc a self-healable and corrosion-free material. These abilities not only help zinc last longer and make it healthy but also keep the structure’s health intact. Eurobond ZCPs not only help the architect in reducing the stress of the future residents but also reduce their maintenance cost, thus making it a desirable material.</p>
        <p style="padding: 0 24px;font-family: roboto;line-height: 22px;">Eurobond ZCPs have been gifted with various other qualities and features as well, features include beautifying with age, good strength against atmospheric aggression, 100% recyclable, a life span of 100 years, purifying the air, and excellent malleability.
