For instance, warm colours can evoke feelings of energy, excitement, and intensity, while cool colours can make you feel calm and serene. And then there are monochromatic colours, the blacks, and whites that generate a feeling of power and sophistication.</p>

                    <div class="panel" style="">
                        <p class="gaptoall">Eurobond Zinc composite panels (ZCP)have brought a revolution in Façade panels with their unique and problem-solving features and qualities that have awestruck the architects. Among the various features, one quality of Eurobond ZCPs has stood out because of its distinctiveness: the power of Self-Healing!</p>
                        <p class="gaptoall">Zinc, a metal used in a composite panel, naturally inherits the power of self-healing. A material that can remain fit by healing scratches and damages on it, and has the ability to resist corrosion! This means the building will be able to self-heal itself and be corrosion-free, reducing the stress of repairs. Let’s see these abilities from the point of view of science. when the surface of Zinc comes in contact with moisture and carbon dioxide in the air, it goes through a unique reaction. A protective layer called a Patina of ‘zinc carbonate forms on its surface, which heals scratches and other damages from the surface, thus making zinc a self-healable and corrosion-free material. These abilities not only help zinc last longer and make it healthy but also keep the structure’s health intact. Eurobond ZCPs not only help the architect in reducing the stress of the future residents but also reduce their maintenance cost, thus making it a desirable material.</p>
                        <p class="gaptoall">Eurobond ZCPs have been gifted with various other qualities and features as well, features include beautifying with age, good strength against atmospheric aggression, 100% recyclable, a life span of 100 years, purifying the air, and excellent malleability. Eurobond ZCPs with its all-around capabilities completely takes care of the buildings ensuring their safety. Because of these qualities, zinc has been used as a cladding material in buildings and architecture. Eurobond ZCPs’ quality of healing is surely a game-changer in Façade panels.</p>
